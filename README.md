# seven_segment_display

This application dsiplays a number on a seven segment digital display, despending which switches are flipped on or off. Each switch is simulated in the code, instead of being assumbed physical, as there was no access to actual FPGA. As a result the code had not been tested on an FPGA. It was developed as coursework for 3rd year university model.
